Architecture for designing and building applications for sharing


background
-

Until recently IT departments would build bespoke systems for their organisation.  
Software houses would build either bespoke systems for a paying customer or build 
generic applications that could be used by any organisation.

Why donâ€™t government development teams build applications that can be used by 
others in government?  All sorts of excuses spring to mind, but none of them are 
insurmountable barriers and the potential benefits are enormous.
